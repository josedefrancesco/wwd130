    <h3>Jose</h3>
    <p>Hello, my name is Jose. I live in Argentina.</p> 
    </p>I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in Applied Technology.</p>
    </p>I'm married, have three daughters, and a 5-month-old granddaughter.</p>
    </p>I work as an assistant to the maintenance manager at the Salta Temple.</p>
    </p>Last summer, I earned my associate's degree. I'm taking this class because it's one of the classes I've been planning for this fall.</p>
    </p>I hope to gain as much knowledge as possible.
I've been a member since I was 5 years old.</p>
